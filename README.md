# Next.js 15 App Router Bug: Unexpected Behavior with Dynamic Routes and Middleware

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes in conjunction with middleware.  The issue involves unexpected behavior and potential inconsistencies in how middleware functions affect the rendering process.

## Bug Description

When a dynamic route is accessed and middleware is involved, there's an inconsistency in how the middleware's actions are reflected in the page's rendering. In some scenarios, the middleware may correctly redirect or modify the response, while in others it behaves unexpectedly, potentially leading to incorrect data display or routing failures.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to a dynamic route (e.g., `/posts/1`). Observe the behavior.
5. Modify the route or middleware and repeat to observe different behaviors. 

## Expected Behavior

The middleware should consistently and predictably influence the response, whether it's a redirect, data modification, or other actions.  The behavior should be consistent across various dynamic route accesses.

## Actual Behavior

The middleware's effects are sometimes inconsistent, with the same dynamic route potentially exhibiting different rendering outcomes depending on factors not immediately clear.

## Solution

The solution may involve adjusting middleware logic, clarifying the interaction between dynamic routes and middleware, or potentially reporting this as a bug to Next.js directly for further investigation and a potential fix.
